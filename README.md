# Python Fundamentals and Customer Support Ticket Analyzer
Project Overview

This repository contains Python assignments and exercises covering core programming concepts such as data structures, loops, functions, and real-world problem solving. The project also includes a Customer Support Ticket Analyzer, which demonstrates practical application of Python for analyzing and managing support data.

These exercises helped build a strong foundation in Python programming, data manipulation, and logical problem solving.

Topics Covered
1. Python Data Structures

Understanding and using built-in data structures:

Lists – storing and manipulating ordered collections

Dictionaries – storing key-value pairs for efficient data retrieval

Sets – handling unique elements and removing duplicates

Tuples – storing immutable collections of data

Strings – text processing and string operations

2. Control Flow and Conditional Statements

Implementing logic using:

if, elif, else conditions

Nested conditions

Decision-making based on data

3. Loops

Using loops for repetitive tasks:

for loops – iterating over lists, dictionaries, and ranges

while loops – executing code until a condition is met

Loop control techniques

4. Functions

Creating reusable and modular code using:

Function definition

Function parameters and return values

Code reusability and organization

5. Customer Support Ticket Analyzer (Mini Project)

A practical implementation that demonstrates:

Processing customer support ticket data

Analyzing ticket categories and trends

Using loops, conditions, and data structures to extract insights

Automating analysis tasks

Files Included
